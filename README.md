	__Disease Recognition:__The project aims to develop algorithms and models that can accurately identify and classify various ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts. By leveraging large datasets of medical images, the project seeks to train deep learning models to automatically detect signs of these diseases.

	Early Detection: Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management of eye diseases. ODIR focuses on developing screening tools that can identify early signs and risk factors associated with ocular conditions. By implementing these tools in routine eye examinations, the project aims to improve the detection of eye diseases at their earliest stages.


	Decision Support Systems: ODIR intends to develop decision support systems that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing eye diseases. These systems would provide clinicians with additional information and analysis to aid in their decision-making process, leading to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.

	Accessibility and Affordability: The project recognizes the importance of making eye healthcare accessible and affordable, particularly in underserved communities and developing regions. ODIR aims to develop technologies that can be deployed in low-resource settings, enabling efficient and cost-effective screening and diagnosis of ocular diseases.
